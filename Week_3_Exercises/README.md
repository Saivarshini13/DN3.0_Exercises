spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa	
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect


Exercise 2: Employee Management System - Creating Entities
Business Scenario: 
Define JPA entities for Employee and Department with appropriate relationships.
Instructions:
1.	Creating JPA Entities:
o	Define Employee entity with fields: id, name, email, department.
o	Define Department entity with fields: id, name.

2.	Mapping Entities to Database Tables:
o	Use annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc.
o	Define one-to-many relationship between Department and Employee.



Exercise 3: Employee Management System - Creating Repositories
Business Scenario: 
Create repositories for Employee and Department entities to perform CRUD operations.
Instructions:
1.	Overview of Spring Data Repositories:
o	Learn the benefits of using Spring Data repositories.
2.	Creating Repositories:
o	Create EmployeeRepository and DepartmentRepository interfaces extending JpaRepository.
o	Define derived query methods in these repositories.

Exercise 4: Employee Management System - Implementing CRUD Operations
Business Scenario: 
Implement CRUD operations for managing employees and departments.
Instructions:
1.	Basic CRUD Operations:
o	Use JpaRepository methods to create, read, update, and delete employees and departments.
o	Implement RESTful endpoints for these operations using EmployeeController and DepartmentController.

Exercise 5: Employee Management System - Defining Query Methods
Business Scenario: 
Enhance your repository to support custom queries.
Instructions:
1.	Defining Query Methods:
o	Use keywords in method names to create custom query methods.
o	Implement custom query methods using the @Query annotation.
2.	Named Queries:
o	Define and execute named queries with @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries.

Exercise 6: Employee Management System - Implementing Pagination and Sorting
Business Scenario: 
Add pagination and sorting capabilities to your employee search functionality.
Instructions:
1.	Pagination:
o	Implement pagination for the employee list using Page and Pageable.
2.	Sorting:
o	Add sorting functionality to your queries.
o	Combine pagination and sorting in your search endpoint.

Exercise 7: Employee Management System - Enabling Entity Auditing
Business Scenario: 
Implement auditing to track the creation and modification of employees and departments.
Instructions:
1.	Entity Auditing:
o	Enable auditing in your application by configuring auditing properties.
o	Use annotations like @CreatedBy, @LastModifiedBy, @CreatedDate, and @LastModifiedDate.

Exercise 8: Employee Management System - Creating Projections
Business Scenario: 
Create projections to fetch specific data subsets from the employee and department entities.
Instructions:
1.	Projections:
o	Define interface-based and class-based projections.
o	Use @Value and constructor expressions to control the fetched data.


Exercise 9: Employee Management System - Customizing Data Source Configuration
Business Scenario: 
Customize your data source configuration and manage multiple data sources.
Instructions:
1.	Spring Boot Auto-Configuration:
o	Leverage Spring Boot auto-configuration for data sources.
2.	Externalizing Configuration:
o	Externalize configuration with application.properties.
o	Manage multiple data sources within your application.

Exercise 10: Employee Management System - Hibernate-Specific Features
Business Scenario: 
Leverage Hibernate-specific features to enhance your application's performance and capabilities.
Instructions:
1.	Hibernate-Specific Annotations:
o	Use Hibernate-specific annotations to customize entity mappings.
2.	Configuring Hibernate Dialect and Properties:
o	Configure Hibernate dialect and properties for optimal performance.
3.	Batch Processing:
o	Implement batch processing with Hibernate for bulk operations.
